This work details the design and implementation of both the software and infrastructure that are necessary to provide public access to a web application for the generation of reports of interest on their use of instant messaging applications.

It aims to contribute to the democratization of the access to data, as well as to raise awareness among users of the information that can be extracted from their private data.

The content of this report explores a set of best practices of software architecture taken into a real production environment, focusing on high availability, scalability, continuous integration and immutability, taking advantage of the speed of development and abstractions allowed by current cloud platforms.
